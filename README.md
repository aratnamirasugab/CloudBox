# Cloud File Storage System

## Overview

Welcome to the **Cloud File Storage System**—a fun little project I've been working on as a hobby! It's a powerful, secure, and scalable platform designed to manage your files effortlessly. Whether you're a casual developer or just someone looking for an easy way to store files, this is your go-to solution. This project is completely open-source because I'd love to share my work with whoever reading this README right now haha.

The system is built with modern cloud technologies, and I'm always looking to improve it. It’s designed for anyone who wants a lightweight, self-hostable file storage solution. Clone it, break it, fork it—just don't forget to share your improvements with the community. ❤️

## Getting Started

To set up this project locally, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for the frontend)
- AWS S3 or MinIO account (for storage)
- PostgreSQL/MySQL database (for user and file metadata)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-file-storage.git
   cd cloud-file-storage
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Set up the following environment variables for AWS S3/MinIO and database configurations:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000`. You can now access the file management interface.
